# BSc Computer Science thesis, case study of Yup: the social dApp of EOSIO blockchain.

Yup is the first social dApp of EOSIO blockchain and one of the most important social dApps in the entire blockchain ecosystem. It allows its users to rate/vote anything that has an url by simply using an extension in their browser. The users are then rewarded with the dApp's cryptocurrency, taking into consideration the quality of their votes and the affidability of the rated contents, for curating across the Web3.

Yup is one of the first projects utilizing a cross-plaftorm and cross-blockchain approach. In fact Yup uses EOSIO blockchain for operating its Smart Contract, because of its high scalabity and fast transactions, and Etheruem blockchain for its liquidity pool (Uniswap v2). This cross-chain approach is possible thanks to a Bridge mechanism that allows the communication and interactions between mentioned blockchains.
